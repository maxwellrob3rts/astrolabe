  Invented in the Middle Ages, the astrolabe allows its user to take readings of their location, the current time, and predict astronomical events. This is achieved by taking measurements in comparison to the sun or surrounding stars. The historian Seb Falk treats the astrolabe with a mythic quality and details how the first time he held one was an emotional experience inflicted due to the device’s beauty and craftsmanship. The astrolabe’s characteristics of fitting multiple functions into a compact and portable device and providing its user with access to the universe cause Seb Falk to describe it as a ‘medieval smartphone’. He expands upon this comparison through detailing how both devices utilise aesthetic and craftsmanship to project status and showcase beauty. He holds the modern iPhone to the same levels of beauty and power, but I don’t believe we treat our smartphones this way. I created this website to try and unlock this beauty in our smartphones and make the act of checking the time a spiritual experience again. Through skeuomorphism, digital craftsmanship, and interaction with surroundings, I sought to create an experience that replicated the emotional weight that the astrolabe carried through its interaction with its user.

  The following interactive experience recreates the physical experience of using an astrolabe to tell the time in an attempt to capture the same spiritual experience this legacy media provided.
