        You just experienced the act of using the astrolabe to take a reading of the time. Did the physicality of this experience change your perception of the act of telling the time? The astrolabe has received a mythic reputation due to its intricate craftsmanship and connection to the stars however, as historian Seb Falk points out, the astrolabe is simply the medieval smartphone. The phone you currently hold in your hand is just as beautiful, contains just as much craftsmanship and provides the universe at the palm of your hand. Why don’t you treat it this way?
